OAuth with Ratpack
================

An OAuth example with Ratpack.

To run the application locally, you need to create a __.env__ file with the following key/values:

```
PUBLIC_ADDRESS="http://localhost:5050"
GOOGLE_ID=XXX-GOOGLE-CLIENT-ID-XXXXX
GOOGLE_SECRET=UUUU-GOOGLE-SECRET-KEY-ZZZZ
```

You also need to create your google api keys.
